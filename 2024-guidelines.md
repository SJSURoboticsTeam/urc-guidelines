# University Rover Challenge 2024 – Requirements and Guidelines

The Mars Society’s University Rover Challenge challenges students to build remotely operated
rovers that can accomplish a variety of tasks that might one day assist astronauts working on the
surface of Mars. Rovers will compete in four missions: 
1. A Science Mission to investigate a site for
the presence of life; 
2. A Delivery Mission to deliver a variety of objects to astronauts in the field
across rugged terrain; 
3. An Equipment Servicing Mission to perform dexterous operations on a mock
lander using a robotic arm; and 
4. An Autonomous Navigation Mission to autonomously travel to a
series of locations. 
For 2024 a drone (aerial vehicle) may be used to assist the rover in the Delivery
Mission, but is not required.

The 2024 University Rover Challenge will be held May 29 – June 1, 2024 at the Mars Society’s Mars
Desert Research Station (MDRS) near Hanksville, Utah, USA. The competition is open to both
graduate and undergraduate students, although teams are permitted to include secondary (high
school) students.

Any issues not covered by these published rule sets will be addressed on a case-by-case basis by the
University Rover Challenge (URC) Director. Please consult the Questions and Answers (Q&A)
portion of the URC web site (http://urc.marssociety.org) for updates. All matters addressed in the
Q&A are applicable to the requirements and guidelines.

## 1. Competition Missions

### 1.a. Scoring  
The rover shall be judged in the four competition missions outlined below and also on the
System Acceptance Review (SAR – described in section 2.a.iii).  
**1.a.i.** Each event and the SAR shall be worth 100 points, for a total of 500 points. Penalties for
overweight rovers, interventions, and other penalties are additive: e.g. penalties of 10%
and 20% would result in a score of 70% of the points earned. Missions are scored
independently and it is not possible to score less than zero on a mission.  
**1.a.ii.** From the time teams are given access to their command station, they shall be able to set
up all necessary systems, including all communications systems, and be **ready to
compete in no more than 15 minutes**. Teams shall be able to fully disassemble all
equipment in no more than 10 minutes at the end of the event, and may be asked to
switch off radio equipment immediately.  
**1.a.iii.** For the four competition events, the rover is not required to be in the same configuration
so modular pieces can be swapped between missions. On days that teams compete in the
Science and Delivery Missions, teams will only compete in one Mission. Teams may be
required to begin the Autonomous Navigation Mission as soon as 10 minutes after the
completion of the Equipment Servicing Mission, operating from the same control station
on an adjacent course.  
**1.a.iv.** Teams do not need to return to the start gate, or collect any deployed items (radio
repeaters, cameras, tools, etc) before the end of time for any of the missions.**
However, they must be collected immediately after competing.  
**1.a.v.** The rover will be accessible throughout the competition and modifications can be made
at any point.  


### 1.b. Science Mission
The goal is to collect samples at sites selected in the field, perform basic science evaluation of
these samples with onboard instrumentation, and store at least one sample as a cache. Sites shall
be analyzed for their likelihood to support microbial life with at least one life detection method
and using the geological context such as evidence of water flow, minerals present and soil
structure in addition to the data obtained from the on-board instrumentation. A single sample
should be collected for analysis and as the cache.  
**1.b.i.** Teams shall submit a written Science Plan by May 17, 2024, which will be factored into
the judges’ evaluation and score for the Science Mission. This will expand upon the
science plan submitted in the System Acceptance Review (see Section 2.a.iii).
Specifications for the plan will posted to the URC website.  
**1.b.ii.** Teams will be given a field briefing by judges to discuss the mission prior to beginning.
Through the information relayed by the rover, teams shall then select sites of potential
biological interest within a 0.5 km radius of the command station. Teams will be given
20 - 30 minutes to collect data with the rover, and may visit as many sites as time allows.  
**1.b.iii.** Teams shall document each site investigated by:
- A wide-angle panorama showing the full context of the site. The panorama must
indicate cardinal directions, and have some indication of scale.
- A close up, well focused, high-resolution picture with some indication of scale (scale
can be indicated post-capture) at the sampling site.
- Teams will be required to take a stratigraphic profile using the on-board cameras to
determine the depositional environment and history of water in the sedimentary
structures visible at the site.
- Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) coordinates of each site, to include
elevation and accuracy range. Thorough documentation is especially crucial for the
sample that is returned onboard the rover.  

**1.b.iv.** At each site the rover will need to determine the absence or presence of life. The rover
may use cameras or other sensors to investigate the area, and may collect a small amount
of regolith/soil for analysis by instrumentation on-board the rover. Samples must be
analyzed by the rover on-site, and may not be brought back to the team for investigation
or laboratory analysis. **The rover must have a life detection capability instrument or
assay** of the team’s choosing. All instruments/tests must be onboard the rover.  
**1.b.v.** Based upon investigation of at least two selected sites, teams shall then **collect a sub-
surface sample from one of the sites at a depth of 10 cm or deeper. Sample(s) must
be at least 5g** and may consist of a single rock, loose soil, or anything in between.
Sample(s) may return the full depth including the topsoil but teams must be able to
distinguish the soil depth for any sample. **The portion of the sample from below 10 cm
will be used to determine the sample mass.
1.b.vi.** After collection of the sample, the rover must then store and seal it in a cache container
onboard the rover, and return the sealed cache to the command station.  
**1.b.vii. Onboard equipment at a minimum should include a science capability of the team’s
choice to accomplish the task goals (life detection method for example) and also test
the soil moisture (relative humidity) and subsurface temperature at least 10 cm
below the surface**. Additional sensors, subsystems, and test procedures are left to the
discretion of the teams to meet the science-driven objectives of this task.  
**1.b.viii.** Any chemicals used onboard, including water and any reaction products, must follow
a no-spill policy of being contained on the rover and not spilt on the ground. **Use of
hazardous chemicals must be pre-approved prior to competition by submitting a
plan of transportation, usage, safety precautions, and accident plan.** Teams should
consider that URC takes place in a remote desert location with very limited water
supplies and no quick access to emergency medical care.
Any tests or liquid, including water, must follow a no-spill policy of being contained on
the rover and not spilt on the ground. Hazardous chemicals are not allowed. All
reagents other than water must be pre-approved prior to competition by submitting a
plan of usage, transportation, and safety precautions (submission form will be posted on
the URC website). Hazardous chemicals are defined by the United States Department of
Transportation (US DOT) on the Hazardous Materials Table.  
**1.b.ix.** After return of the rover to the command station, teams shall remove the cached sample
from the rover, while minimizing any possibility of contamination.  
**1.b.x.** After giving the cached sample to the judges, teams will have a debrief and discussion
with the judges. Discussion with the judges is allowed even if the rover was
unsuccessful in performing any of the field tasks. The discussion should include:
- The stratigraphic profile and evidence of water in the profile.
- Results of on-board rover and laboratory tests performed.
- Method used to ensure sample was collected at least 10 cm below the surface and
transferred to the judges without contamination.
- Reasoning for sample site selection and documentation of each of the two sites.
- Meaning of data collected with respect to the habitability potential, the geology of the
site (past and present) and implications of the site being suitable for life.
- Scientific knowledge of Mars based on responses to judges’ questions.  
**1.b.xi.** The score for this task will be based on the Science Plan and the following components:
- Thoroughness of the investigation of sites (panoramas, site selection, stratigraphic
profile).
- Quality and applicability of the onboard and laboratory analysis (moisture,
temperature, science capability of choice).
- Quality of the sample returned (weight, depth, possible contamination).
- Scientific knowledge of astrobiology.  

### 1.c. Delivery Mission
**1.c.i.** This will be a staged mission in which rovers shall be required to assist astronauts in the
field by completing tasks (such as finding, picking up, and delivering objects), all while
traversing terrain of increasing difficulty. Teams will be given a fixed amount of time for
each stage. Each stage will include multiple tasks as described below, and teams must
achieve a specified minimum score on Stage 1 within the allotted time in order to
proceed to Stage 2. Any time remaining at the completion of Stage 1 is added to the
allotted time of Stage 2. Total on-course time will be 30-60 minutes. A script giving a
general description of the individual tasks will be given to the teams prior to the
competition.  
**1.c.ii.** The objectives in each stage can be conducted in any order and may combine tasks, but
once a team has started on a Stage 2 task they cannot return to complete any Stage 1
tasks. Teams will be informed once they have scored enough points to start Stage 2 and
may either move directly onto Stage 2 or may finish any remaining Stage 1 tasks, up to
the time limit for Stage 1.  
**1.c.iii.** The natural terrain around MDRS includes soft sandy areas, gravel, rough stony areas,
rock and boulder fields, vertical drops, and steep loosely consolidated slopes. Terrain
will range from flat close to the starting line, to exceedingly difficult obstacles at
distances of up to 1 km from the start gate also involving navigation challenges. Portions
of this mission, in later tasks, will be intentionally placed beyond direct line-of-sight of the control station antenna.  
**1.c.iv.** The rover teams can expect a combination of any or all of the following tasks:
- Follow a marked path that requires precise maneuvering of the rover.
- Open boxes with hinged lids (such as a toolbox).
- Pick up, carry, and deliver objects to a different location. Objects may consist of
small lightweight hand tools, small instruments, supply containers, or rocks up to 5
kg in mass. All objects will have a graspable feature (varying in complexity from a
handle to natural features) no greater than 7.5 cm wide. The maximum dimensions
for any object shall be no larger than 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm.
- Conduct a visual search for objects that are within 20 m of provided coordinates.
- Read signs carried by astronauts or placed in the field.
- Visually identify rocks of geological interest. This will require an operator with
geological knowledge. No instruments beyond a camera will be needed.
- A cart will be provided for some tasks to help carry multiple items. Teams may use or
ignore the cart as they chose.
- Operate in an area beyond line of sight communication with the base station.  

**1.c.v.** Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) coordinates will be provided for each pickup/delivery location. 
In certain cases, specific instructions will be provided for each object in advance, and in other cases, the object(s) to be 
delivered will be indicated at the delivery location (for example on a small sign held by an astronaut). Working GNSS is essential 
for this mission.  
**1.c.vi.** Teams will be scored on their ability to pick up and deliver the correct objects to the
correct locations. Points may be awarded for partial completion of any particular task.  

### 1.d. Drone Requirements
**1.d.i.** Use of a drone is optional for task assistance in the Delivery Mission. Drones will be
remotely operated by a pilot in the control station.  
**1.d.ii.** Drones may be fixed or rotary wing, but no lighter-than-air vehicles are not allowed as
they are impractical on Mars. **Drones are exempted from the weight, size, and budget
restrictions for the rover and other deployed equipment, however must still comply
with all communications requirements.  
**1.d.iii.** **The combined mass of drones and all payloads/dummy mass may not exceed 5 kg
(11 lb). All drones in excess of 250 g (0.55 lb) must be registered with the United
States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) DroneZone and marked with the
registration number**.  
**1.d.iv. All pilots must complete the FAA TRUST** (The Recreational UAS Safety Test), and
**carry proof of passing** with them. It is a free online training course that takes about 30
minutes, and is valid for 3 years.  
**1.d.v.** Airborne vehicles must meet any and all FAA guidelines that apply to recreational drone
operation. It will be the responsibility of each team to research and comply with FAA
requirements. The area around MDRS is class G (uncontrolled) airspace, and drones are
required to fly **below 400 feet (120m) above ground level**. Please beware that MDRS is
fairly close to Capitol Reef National Park, and **drones are not permitted in National
Parks**. It is also about 5 miles from the uncontrolled Hanksville airport, and drones must
give way to any manned aircraft.  
**1.d.vi. A spotter must maintain visual line of sight at all times.** The pilot will not have a
direct view of the drone so a designated team member in the field must act as a spotter.
In the event of an emergency the spotter will use radio communication with the pilot to
avoid unsafe behavior of the drone, or may take direct control of the drone if a dual-pilot setup is used. 
The spotter may only intervene in the event of potentially unsafe operation, and may not otherwise 
participate in the mission. The spotter is required to ensure safe flight of the drone, and shall ensure that 
the drone keeps a safe distance from all people and structures during flight. At the judges’ discretion, a spotter’s intervention
with the drone will count as a “kill switch.” In this case the drone will not be permitted
to continue on the mission, but the rover can.  
**1.d.vii.** To simulate flight on Mars the drone must carry a dummy (inert) mass of the same
weight as the battery. The dummy mass and battery must be easy to remove for
weighing. In the event of high winds (>24 kph/15 mph), the dummy mass
requirement will be waived.  
**1.d.viii.** Drones should be able to operate in a 48 kph/30 mph wind. This requires a top speed
of least 64 kph/40 mph for safe operation. Teams may fly their drone in any wind speeds
they feel confident it can handle. Teams should expect highly variable wind conditions
throughout URC, and are not guaranteed that they will be scheduled during a period of
low wind.  
**1.d.ix.** Drones may take off from either the rover or the control station at any time. Teams must
announce when the drone is being launched for safety purposes. The drone may land in
any safe location that does not interfere with the course (such as on an astronaut).
### 1.e. Equipment Servicing Mission
**1.e.i.** Rovers shall be required to perform several dexterous operations on a mock-up
equipment system. The rover shall have to travel up to 0.25 km across relatively flat
terrain to reach the equipment. Equipment will be between 1.5m height and the ground.
The equipment servicing mission will involve delivering a cached science sample to a
lander and performing maintenance on the lander. It will include the following sub-tasks
which may be performed in any order:
- Pick up the cache container and transport to the lander rocket. Cache will have a
handle at least 10 cm long and not more than 5 cm in diameter. Cache will weigh less
than 5 kg.
- Open a drawer on the lander. Insert cache into a close-fitting space in the drawer, and
close the drawer.
- Tighten captive screw to secure drawer. Screw will be a 5/16” Allen (hex) head.
Teams may build the hex driver into the rover, or pick up the screwdriver provided.
- Undo a latch on a hinged panel of the lander and open panel.
- Type commands on a keyboard and follow directions on computer display. Typing
must be correct for full points, but spelling mistakes or repeated letters may be
corrected using the backspace/delete button or ignored for partial points.
- Operate a joystick (4-position, spring-return) to direct an antenna while observing a
gauge. Gauge will be up to 20cm away from the joystick.
- Pick up and insert a rugged USB memory stick into a USB (type A) slot on the
lander.
- Push buttons, flip switches, turn knobs.  

**1.e.ii.** Teams will receive points for every sub-task completed successfully. Teams will have 30
minutes to complete the mission.

### 1.f. Autonomous Navigation Mission
**1.f.i.** Teams may be required to begin this mission as soon as 10 minutes after the completion
of the Equipment Servicing Mission, operating from the same control station on an
adjacent course. Total time on course will be 30-60 minutes, and the cumulative distance shall be no greater than 2 km.  
**1.f.ii.** Rover shall be required to autonomously traverse to 2 GNSS-only locations, 3 posts
marked with Augmented Reality (AR) tags, and 2 objects left on the ground. **Teams
may visit locations in any order, but must declare when they are attempting an
objective out of order.** Teams will be provided with a high-accuracy coordinate at a
start post as a reference. Teams are strongly encouraged to implement differential GNSS
for higher accuracy.  
**1.f.iii.** The 2 locations with only GNSS coordinates will be given highly accurate coordinates
without any visual markers to enable computer vision to be of assistance. Stopping
within 3 m of the GNSS location will be considered successful.  
**1.f.iv.** The 3 posts will have GNSS coordinates that are within the vicinity of the posts,
increasing in range from approximately 5-20 m. Stopping within 2 m of the post will be
considered successful. The posts will have 3-sided visual markers with 20 x 20 cm faces,
0.5-1.5 m off the ground. **Each marker will display a black and white ARUCO tag
using the 4x4_50 tag library as shown below.** Each tag will have a white border 1 cell
in width, so cells are 2.5 cm across. The same tag will be displayed on each of the 3
sides so that it is visible from any direction.  
**1.f.v.** The 2 objects will have GNSS coordinates within the vicinity of the objects (<10 m).
Autonomous detection of the tools will be required. The first object will be an orange
rubber mallet (see similar object here). The second object will be a standard 1 L wide-
mouthed plastic water bottle of unspecified color/markings (approximately 21.5 cm tall
by 9 cm diameter). **The second object may have obstacles in the way that require
autonomous avoidance.** Rovers are not required to interact with the objects, but must
stop within 2m to be considered successful.  
**1.f.vi.** There must be an LED indicator on the back of the rover, visible in bright daylight (e.g.
LED array or high power LED), that will signal:
- **Red** : Autonomous operation
- **Blue** : Teleoperation (Manually driving)
- **Flashing Green** : Successful arrival at a location.  

**1.f.vii.** The rover’s on-board systems are required to decide when it has reached a location. The
rover must then stop and signal using the LED indicator. It must also display a message
or signal on the operator’s display for the control station judge to observe.  
**1.f.viii.** Operators may at any point send a signal to the rover to abort the current attempt and
autonomously return to the previous GNSS coordinate, post, or object, and stop within
10 m of it. **Operators may teleoperate back to the previous location or GNSS
coordinate for a 20% penalty on the points available for that location.
Teleoperation should take the most direct reasonable route back and may not go
scouting for the location.** There is no penalty for an autonomous return.  
**1.f.ix.** While stopped at any location (whether after a successful arrival, an unsuccessful arrival,
or from an abort), teams may program the next or previous location and make any
changes to the controls, but may not drive the rover.  

## 2. Competition Rules

### 2.a. Schedule
Prospective teams will undergo a review and down-selection process, meaning that only teams
who pass each milestone will be invited to compete in the field. Teams failing to qualify for the
field competition are strongly encouraged to enter other Rover Challenge Series events
(http://rcs.marssociety.org/). Specific details for each deadline (including deliverable format,
submission requirements, and judges' expectations) will be posted to the URC web site
(http://urc.marssociety.org). Judges may respond to teams with follow-up questions or requests
for clarification at any of these milestones.  
**2.a.i. Registration**
Teams are required to register and declare their intent to compete **no later than
Wednesday, October 25, 2023.** No significant deliverables are required for this
deadline, aside from team details requested via the URC web site.  
**2.a.ii. Preliminary Design Review**
Teams are required to submit a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) document no later
than Friday, December 1, 2023. The PDR document must include the team structure,
resources, and project management plan (including a Gantt chart, initial budget, fund-
raising plans, recruiting, and educational outreach). Technical details regarding the rover
should include the current state of design, development, and prototyping. Judges will be
assessing each team's overall likelihood of being ready in time to compete in the URC
competition. Teams will be assessed on their own merits, not against other teams.  
**2.a.iii. System Acceptance Review**
Teams are required to submit a System Acceptance Review (SAR) no later than Friday,
March 1, 2024. The SAR will focus on demonstration of the capabilities and
customization of the rover systems/sub-systems to perform each of the missions. This
includes the overall system design, and progress to-date of the final system. The SAR
will consist of both written and video components. The SAR is a competitive milestone
and packages will be judged against other teams’ submissions by the judges. The 36
teams who score the highest in the SAR milestone will be invited to compete in the field.  
**2.a.iv. Field Competition**
May 29 – June 1, 2024 at the Mars Society’s Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS)
near Hanksville, Utah, USA.

### 2.b. Operations
**2.b.i.** Teams will operate their rovers in real-time from designated command and control
stations. These stations will be metal trailer units (such as the back of a small moving
truck provided by URC) or structures at the Mars Desert Research Station. **Visibility of
the course to the operators in the control station will be blocked.** Basic power (120V,
60Hz), tables, and chairs will be provided. All of the competition events will be held in
full daylight.  
**2.b.ii.** There should be radio communication line-of-sight from the command station to the
rover for the Science, Equipment Servicing, and Autonomous Navigation Missions. For
the Delivery Mission, line of sight communication is not guaranteed for more than 50%
of the course. Rovers are not expected to travel more than 1 km from the command
station.  
**2.b.iii.** In the summer temperatures at MDRS can easily reach 100°F and winds frequently whip
up dust. Rovers shall be able to withstand these conditions and also light rain, but will
not be expected to compete in heavy rain or thunderstorms.  
**2.b.iv.** Testing will not be allowed at MDRS before, during, or after URC 2024. Teams may
test in town or at other nearby sites where off-road vehicles are allowed (such as the
Factory Butte Special Recreation Management Area), but must follow local regulations
regarding off-road activity. Land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, that is
not specifically designated for off-road use, is strictly not allowed for any URC
purposes.  
**2.b.v.** The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) standard shall be the WGS 84 datum.
Coordinates will be provided in latitude/longitude format (e.g. decimal degrees; degrees
decimal minutes; degrees minutes seconds).
### 2.c. Team Members
**2.c.i.** There is no restriction on the number of team members allowed. Students must be
enrolled at least half-time in a degree or high school diploma granting course. Students
from multiple universities may compete on the same team. A single university may field
multiple rovers and multiple teams, however there may be no overlap between team
members, budget, donated equipment, or purchased equipment.  
**2.c.ii.** Teams are encouraged to work with advisors. Advisors should limit their involvement to
academic level advising only. Nontechnical management duties, including tracking
finances, registration, submission of deliverables, and communication with URC staff,
fall within the duties of the students. Advisors can spectate from the field, but may not
spectate from within the control station.  
**2.c.iii.** All team members operating the rover must remain in the designated operators’ area.
Nobody may follow alongside the rover for the purpose of providing feedback to the
operators. Members of the judging team, media, non-operator team members, and other
spectators may only follow a rover at the judges' discretion. Team members following
the rover may participate as runners in accordance with Section 3.d, or activate an
emergency kill switch (in the event of an emergency), but may not otherwise participate
in that mission.  
**2.c.iv.** It is incumbent upon the student team leaders to ensure that their respective teams
uphold the integrity of this competition.

### 2.d. Finances
**2.d.i.** Teams shall be required to track all finances as related to this project, and submit a final
expense record no later than May 22, 2024 (if necessary, teams may submit an updated
record on the first day of the URC event – May 29, 2024). Teams shall be penalized 10%
of total points per day if they are late in submitting the expense report, and will be
disqualified for not submitting their expense report by the end of the URC event (June 1,
2024).  
**2.d.ii.** The maximum allowable cash budget to be spent on the project is **$22,000 US** , which
shall include components for the rover, rover modules, rover power sources, rover
communications equipment, and base station equipment including the antenna and
transceiver, and all command and control equipment (i.e. base station computers,
monitors, controllers, etc.).  
**2.d.iii.** The Director may allow certain sponsorships that are available to all teams to count as an
extension of the budget limit.  
**2.d.iv.** The budget limit shall not apply to travel expenses, tools, prototype parts not used on the
fielded rover, and spare parts that can be replaced one-for-one in the case of damage to the original.  
**2.d.v.** If used equipment is purchased commercially the as-bought price may be used. Re-used
equipment from prior competitions must be valued at either the original as-bought cost,
or the current cost for a new version of the same or equivalent item.  
**2.d.vi.** Any equipment rented must be valued at purchase cost (new or used).  
**2.d.vii.** Shipping and taxes must be included in the cost since these are a standard part of the cost
of any item.  
**2.d.viii.** Corporate sponsorship is encouraged. If equipment or services are donated to the team
either free or at reduced cost, the full cost of a new or second-hand component must be
used. Donations must be documented by the donor, but teams may use the cheapest rate
commercially available for the same equipment or service.  
**2.d.ix.** Non-US teams have an allowable budget equivalent to $22,000 US based on the most
advantageous documented currency conversion rate between August 1, 2023 and May
22, 2024.  
**2.d.x.** Teams may be required to submit receipts as proof of budget upon request.

## 3. Rover Rules

### 3.a. Size, Weight, Power
**3.a.i.** The rover shall be a stand-alone, off-the-grid, mobile platform. Tethered power and
communications are not allowed. A single rover carrying all deployable items (except
the drone) must leave the designated start gate. In the open field, the rover may deploy
any number of smaller sub-platforms, so long as the combined master/slave sub-
platforms meet all additional requirements published.  
**3.a.ii.** Rovers shall be weighed by the judges during the set-up time of each mission. For
weighing the rover **must fit completely within a 1.2 m x 1.2 m x 1.2m box**. Rovers
may be placed in any orientation, and articulate/fold/bend to fit within the “transport
crate,” but may not be disassembled to do so. This includes wheels, antenna, and any
other system protruding from the rover. **Failure to fit within the specified dimensions
at weigh-in will result in a 40% penalty. After weighing, rovers may unfold/expand
to any size.  
**3.a.iii.** The maximum allowable mass of the rover when deployed for any competition mission
is **50 kg**. The total mass of all fielded rover parts for all events is **70 kg**. For example, a
modular rover may have a robotic arm and a science module that are never on the rover
at the same time. The combinations of rover plus arm and rover plus science module
must each be under 50 kg, but the total rover plus arm plus science module must be less
than 70 kg.
- The weight limits do not include any spares or tools used to prepare or maintain the
rover, but does include any items deployed by the rover such as sub-rovers, cameras,
communication relays.
- For each event in which the rover is overweight, the team shall be assessed a penalty
of 5% of the points scored, per kilogram over 50.  
**3.a.iv.** Rovers shall utilize power and propulsion systems that are applicable to operations on
Mars. Air-breathing systems are not permitted: No power or propulsion system may
ingest ambient air for the purpose of combustion or other chemical reaction that yields
energy.  
**3.a.v.** **All rovers shall have a “kill switch” that is readily visible and accessible on the
exterior of the rover.** This switch shall immediately stop the rover’s movement and
cease all power draw from batteries in the event of an emergency such as a battery fire.
- The kill switch shall be a red push button at least 3 cm in diameter, and be mounted
away from moving parts in an obvious and unobstructed place on the rover.
- Teams are also strongly encouraged to implement a “heartbeat” monitor onboard the
rover that prevents an uncontrolled runaway rover if communications with the control
station are lost.
### 3.b. Communications Equipment
**3.b.i.** The rover shall be operated remotely using wireless communications with no time delay.
The operators will not be able to directly view the rover or the site, and line-of-sight
communications are not guaranteed for all of the missions. Normal wireless internet is
not available in the field or at MDRS, and use of satellite internet is not allowed. Teams
are required to power down communications equipment at the event sites while not
competing, so as not to interfere with other teams.  
**3.b.ii.** Wireless communication methods used by teams shall adhere to all applicable FCC
(United States Federal Communications Commission) standards and regulations. Teams
must submit details regarding communication devices and operator licenses (when
applicable) no later than Friday, May 3, 2024. Team members are permitted to obtain
and utilize any relevant licenses, but must document the license, applicable regulations,
and devices as part of the communications documentation deadline. Teams must notify
the URC Director immediately of any changes after this date.  
**3.b.iii.** Both omnidirectional and directional antennae are allowed, but communications
equipment must not rely on the team’s ability to watch and track the rover first hand.
Steered directional antennae may use a mechanized antenna mounted outside that is
controlled via an electronic signal from the command station. Signal strength, relayed
GNSS, or other strategies may be used to give feedback on antenna direction, but it is
not allowed to mount a camera on top of the antenna for visual feedback.  
**3.b.iv.** **Base station antenna height is limited to 3m** , and shall adhere to all applicable
regulations. Any antennae must be documented as part of the communications
documentation submitted by May 3, 2024. Antenna bases must be located within 5
meters of the team’s command station, and any ropes or wires used for stability purposes
only may be anchored within 10 meters of the command station. The exception to this is
the use of structures at the MDRS where allowable antennae locations will be given by
the judge and may be located up to 20m away from the Hab to avoid underground pipe
and cables, and other structures which may block radio signals. **All teams should bring
at least 25m of communications cable** to deal with this scenario.

### 3.c. Restrictions on the 900 MHz and 2.4GHz bands
Teams must notify the organizers of the communications standards they will be using, including
frequency bands and channels, by May 3, 2024.  
**3.c.i.** 900 MHz frequency band (902-928 MHz): Teams shall not use frequency bandwidths
greater than 8 MHz. **Teams must also be able to operate exclusively within each of
the following three sub-bands: "900-Low" (902-910 MHz), "900-Mid" (911- 919
MHz), and "900-High" (920-928 MHz). The competition schedule will notify teams
which sub-band may be used for each mission, and teams must be able to shift to
another sub-band as required.** There is no limit on the number of 900 MHz channels a
team uses, so long as they are all within the designated sub-band.  
**3.c.ii.** **2.4 GHz frequency band (2.400-2.4835 GHz): Teams shall use center frequencies
that correspond to channels 1-11 of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers) 802.11 standard for 2.4 GHz.** Teams shall not use frequency
bandwidths greater than 22 MHz. The competition schedule will notify teams which
channels may be used for each mission, and teams must be able to shift to other
channels as required. Teams shall be limited to using no more than three channels
in the 2.4 GHz band. Teams using wifi (802.11) must learn how to manually set the
channel on their equipment.  
**3.c.iii.** These restrictions apply to both the command station and rover communications.
This includes (but is not limited to) Bluetooth devices and any local wireless
network (i.e. LAN) between devices at the command station, onboard the rover, or
between the command station and rover. Communications with a drone shall also
follow these restrictions.  
**3.c.iv.** Teams may use spread spectrum or narrowband (fixed channel allocation) within the
sub-band limits as they fit.  
**3.c.v.** There will be spectrum monitoring on-site to ensure that teams are not interfering with
channels outside those allotted. Teams should anticipate being within signal range of
other teams operating on different 900 MHz sub-bands and different 2.4GHz channels
and be able to operate their rover under these conditions. Teams must also be able to
deconflict communications as specified above (URC judges will mediate as necessary).
Beyond this requirement a 0.5 km minimum separation between competition areas will
be guaranteed, which will include large terrain barriers.  
**3.c.vi.** Teams are allowed and highly encouraged to operate in bands outside of 900 MHz and
2.4 GHz and are also encouraged to obtain ham radio licenses to allow operation on less
used bands., However, in the event of interference outside of 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz,
teams will not be granted additional time or special considerations. Outside the
900MHz and 2.4GHz bands, teams are strongly encouraged to investigate spread
spectrum, automatic channel switching, frequency hopping, or other interference-tolerant
protocols.
### 3.d. Interventions
If a rover suffers a critical problem during a mission that requires direct team intervention (any
action requiring touching of the rover), that intervention shall be subject to the following:
**3.d.i.** A request for an intervention can only come from the team members operating the
rover, not any team members spectating in the field.** They may designate any number
of team members who may go to repair or retrieve the rover (hereafter referred to as
“runners”). Spectating team members may be asked to act as runners, and also rover
operators may leave the command station and become runners. Spectating team
members may carry tools and the command station may radio out to them to request an
intervention.  
**3.d.ii.** If a spectating team member intervenes with the rover without request from the
operators, it counts as an emergency stop.** This is allowed such as to rescue the rover
to prevent a fall or a fire. The current mission will be considered terminated although the
rover may compete in other subsequent missions. All points earned in a mission to this
point are preserved, and in the Science Mission teams may still conduct their field
briefing.  
**3.d.iii. If a team member leaves the command station to become a runner they will not be
permitted to return to the command station** to participate in operating the rover, or
analysis of any data, after this point for the current mission. Runners will still be
permitted to retrieve or repair the rover in future interventions.  
**3.d.iv.** Runners may fix the rover in the field without moving it, or return the rover to the
command station, or return the rover to the start of that obstacle/mission as defined by 
the judge in the field. However, the judge may require the rover to be moved for the
safety of the team members or preservation of the course.  
**3.d.v.** If the rover is returned to the command station, the operators may take part in the
diagnostic and repair process, but runners and spectators may not communicate any
details about the mission site to the operators.  
**3.d.vi.** When an intervention is called, the team members in the field may communicate directly
with their team members operating the rover to facilitate repairs. **If teams wish to use
radios for this purpose they must bring their own radios, but they may be used only
during an intervention. All radio communication must be in English so judges can
properly monitor conversations.  
**3.d.vii.** Teams will be **penalized 20% of the total points in that mission for every
intervention**. The mission clock will continue to run during an intervention. Multiple
intervention penalties in a single mission are additive: e.g. two interventions would
result in a score of 60% of points earned.
